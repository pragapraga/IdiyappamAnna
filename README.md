# IdiyappamAnna :smile:
This android based mobile app helps people who wants to have south indian home food called Idiyappam.

The idea of this project hitted my mind when i was sleeping and forgot to call Idiyappam Anna as usually i do whenever mom is not available to 
feed my stomach with Idiyappam:)

Short Note on Idiyappam Anna and about the app
Idiyappam Anna will come to our home area sharply at 6:40 am (1st round), 8:40 am (2nd round) and evening 6:00 pm (3rd round). As a customer 
i should get alert or kind of alarm whenever he comes to near home. If the customer is insterested to buy Idiyappam, Idiyappam Anna app should
show the shortest path in his map view.

Note: I am planning to present him with the mobile after implementing the idea.If i am explain him now, he will not get the idea. We should 
implement this and then we should show him. Definitely he may add some more points.

App will have two logins

1. Idiyappam Anna Login
2. Customers Login

This is rough idea and we can build upon with other components as the time grows.
